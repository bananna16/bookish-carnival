Simple JavaScript calculator! Has the simple operations of add, substract, divide, multiply and modulo. For now, it only allows for calculations including 2 operands and 1 operator. 

Future Improvements:
----
* Allow for calculations with multiple operands at one time
* Add button for allowing parentheses
* keep screen for showing past / full operation
* add keyboard support
